        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Rabbits are small mammals with fluffy, short tails, whiskers and distinctive long ears. There are more than 30 species around the world, and while they live in many different environments, they have many things in common.
        </p>
        <h1>Size</h1>
        <p>Some rabbits are about the size of a cat, and some can grow to be as big as a small child. Small rabbits, such as pygmy rabbits, can be as little as 8 inches (20 centimeters) in length and weigh less than a pound. Larger species grow to 20 inches (50 cm) and more than 10 lbs. (4.5 kilograms). </p>
        <h1>Diet</h1>
        <p>Rabbits are herbivores. This means that they have a plant-based diet and do not eat meat. Their diets include grasses, clover and some cruciferous plants, such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. They are opportunistic feeders and also eat fruits, seeds, roots, buds, and tree bark, according to ADW. Some domestic rabbits eat like to eat sweet things like kheer(sweet rice) and chocolate etc. </p>
        <h1>Habitat</h1>
        <p>While originally from Europe and Africa, rabbits are now found all over the world. They occupy most of the worldâ€™s land masses, except for southern South America, the West Indies, Madagascar, and most islands southeast of Asia, according to ADW. Although originally absent from South America, Australia, New Zealand, Java, rabbits have been introduced to these locations during the last few centuries.

            Domestic rabbits need a regulated environment to protect against heat exhaustion or hypothermia. Wild rabbits don't have this problem and make their homes in various temperature extremes. Wild rabbits can be found in woods, forests, meadows, grasslands, deserts, tundra and wetlands.

            Wild rabbits create their own homes by tunneling into the ground. These tunnel systems are called warrens and include rooms for nesting and sleeping. They also have multiple entrances for quick escape.</p>
        <h1>Habits</h1>
        <p>Rabbits are very social creatures and live in large groups called colonies. The busiest time of day for rabbits is at dusk and dawn. This is when they venture out to find food. The low light allows them to hide from predators.
            They also like to bite everything from wood to paper.They often bite people though it not harm. Rabbits have a habit of playing with ball or sphere things and living in narrow space is one of their favourite activity. Bunny like cool places because of their lots of fur on their skin. In summer they like to stay in cool places such as in front of AC(air-conditioner) or cooler etc. Rabbits like to eat and if we don't stop them they eat all the time till they are not tired. </p>
        <h1>Other facts</h1>
        <p>Rabbits can be very crafty and quick. To get away from a predator, a cottontail rabbit will run in a zigzag pattern and reach speeds of up to 18 mph (29 km/h), according to National Geographic.

            Their ears can grow to 4 inches (10 cm). This stretched-out length allows them to better hear predators that may be approaching. It also allows them to stay cool in hot climates. Extra body heat is released through blood vessels in the ear.

            Their eyes are made for safety, too, since each eye can rotate 360 degrees. This allows them to look behind them without turning their heads.

            Rabbits don't get a lot of nourishment from their diet. They often eat their own excrement to access any remaining nourishment that their digestive system may have missed the first time.</p>
